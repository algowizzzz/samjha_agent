China Fixed Income Trading (CVaR Limit)\n  2. European Prime Finance (CVaR Limit)\n- Most high-utilization limits are in Financials industry (6/8 limits)\n- Regions represented include Asia, EMEA, Canada, and Americas\n- Limit types vary: CVaR, PV01, Gamma Vega, Liquidity, Stress Limits\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Immediately review and potentially adjust limits for China Fixed Income and European Prime Finance, which are at 100% utilization\n2. Conduct a risk assessment for trading desks with limits near capacity\n3. Consider implementing more dynamic limit management processes\n4. Develop early warning triggers at 85-90% utilization to proactively manage risk\n\n**Risk Profile:**\n- High Risk: China Fixed Income, European Prime Finance\n- Moderate Risk: Canadian Options, SET Management, Environmental Commodities\n- Watch List: US Tactical & Accrual, Securitized Credit Trading",

China Fixed Income Trading (CVaR Limit)\n  2. European Prime Finance (CVaR Limit)\n- Most high-utilization limits are in Financials industry (6/8 limits)\n- Regions represented include Asia, EMEA, Canada, and Americas\n- Limit types vary: CVaR, PV01, Gamma Vega, Liquidity, Stress Limits\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Immediately review and potentially adjust limits for China Fixed Income and European Prime Finance, which are at 100% utilization\n2. Conduct a risk assessment for trading desks with limits near capacity\n3. Consider implementing more dynamic limit management processes\n4. Develop early warning triggers at 85-90% utilization to proactively manage risk\n\n**Risk Profile:**\n- High Risk: China Fixed Income, European Prime Finance\n- Moderate Risk: Canadian Options, SET Management, Environmental Commodities\n- Watch List: US Tactical & Accrual, Securitized Credit Trading",
