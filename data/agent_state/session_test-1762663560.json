Immediately review and potentially expand limits for these high-utilization entries to prevent potential trading or operational constraints\n2. Investigate the reasons behind near-full limit utilization, particularly for Global Unsecured Funding and European Unsecured Funding\n3. Consider implementing more dynamic limit allocation strategies to provide more flexibility\n4. Set up real-time alerts for limits approaching 90% utilization to enable proactive management\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- High utilization rates suggest potential operational risk and limited financial flexibility\n- Recommend a comprehensive review of current limit allocation strategies across different business units and regions",

Immediately review and potentially expand limits for these high-utilization entries to prevent potential trading or operational constraints\n2. Investigate the reasons behind near-full limit utilization, particularly for Global Unsecured Funding and European Unsecured Funding\n3. Consider implementing more dynamic limit allocation strategies to provide more flexibility\n4. Set up real-time alerts for limits approaching 90% utilization to enable proactive management\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- High utilization rates suggest potential operational risk and limited financial flexibility\n- Recommend a comprehensive review of current limit allocation strategies across different business units and regions",
